Select option 3 (Create a Payload and Listener).
Select the appropriate option based on the target operating system and payload type:
For Windows:
Option 1 (Windows Reverse_TCP)
Option 2 (Windows Bind_TCP)
Option 3 (Windows Reverse_HTTPS)
Option 4 (Windows Bind_HTTPS)
For Linux/Unix:
Option 5 (Linux/Unix Reverse_TCP)
Option 6 (Linux/Unix Bind_TCP)
Option 7 (Linux/Unix Reverse_HTTPS)
Option 8 (Linux/Unix Bind_HTTPS)
Enter the local IP address and port number for the listener.
Choose the payload type (exe, dll, elf, or aspx).
Select the appropriate option based on the attack method:
